# Create your views here.

# Django sees each website page to serve a certain purpose, and therefore can be boiled down to a function (def). each one of these functions
# are included in the views python file. 

# The render() function takes the request object as its 
# first argument, a template name as its second argument
# and a dictionary as its optional third argument. 
# It returns an HttpResponse object of the given template 
# rendered with the given context. The context is usually used as a dictionary
# that can be used in the html file for conditional operations.

# The shortcut get_object_or_404() raises the Http404 exception 
# if a question with the requested ID doesnâ€™t exist.
